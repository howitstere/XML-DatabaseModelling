# XML-DatabaseModelling
LANGUAGE HOLIDAY AGENCY PROJECT - Project on the modelling of an XML database which manages the data of a language holiday agency.

## Abstract

The XML database proposed is called “LANGUAGE-HOLIDAY-AGENCY”, it is structured based on the region group to which each country belongs.
There are 3 different countries and 2 cities for each country, for this reason there are a total of 6 offices, 12
different employees, 9 different offers, 18 different activities, and more than 18 different participants.
The agency is divided into two groups, a European group with attribute id=“E” and an Asian one with group
id=“A”. Each country has two different offices based in 2 different cities, for France, the offices are in Paris
and Nice, for Italy there are Rome and Bologna, while for Thailand the offices are in Bangkok and Phuket. Since
Paris, Rome, and Bangkok are the capital cities of these countries they are also the main offices of the agency,
for this reason, they propose two offers for the language holiday, while the other cities propose one offer.
